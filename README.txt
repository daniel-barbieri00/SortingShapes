70% complete

all aspects written and should work together
we were unable to put everything together propory so the program does not run
issues with java compatability made the command line start unable to run
sorts were made with an error that required more time then expected to fix and thats why it doesnt run
tests would work if everything else would run
shapes and the shapeADT are all set up

we know that this is incomplete, misteps in compatibility between java versions and git repos on eclipse disconnected our work and each worked on separate parts
this caused issues when finishing the project
